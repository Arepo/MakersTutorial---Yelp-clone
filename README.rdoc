== Yelp clone

From week 7 of Makers, a tutorial driven project, introducing us various Rails aspects - mainly Active Record, form helpers, AJAX, and PostgreSQL.

It's basic logic only with no CSS - as with other Makers projects, it's mainly here as reference for when I need to use one of the relevant technologies.

To see it in all its ASCII glory (with a couple of seed restaurants), run 'rails s' in the root folder, and open localhost:3000 in browser of choice.
